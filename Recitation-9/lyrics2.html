<p>
  In a little while<br>
  Surely you'll be mine<br>
  In a little while... I'll be there<br>
  In a little while<br>
  This hurt will hurt no more<br>
  I'll be home, love<br></p>
  <p>
  When the night takes a deep breath<br>
  And the daylight has no air<br>
  If I crawl, if I come crawling home<br>
  Will you be there?<br></p>
  <p>
  In a little while<br>
  I won't be blown by every breeze<br>
  Friday night running to Sunday on my knees<br>
  That girl, that girl she's mine<br>
  Well I've known her since<br>
  Since she was<br></p>
  <p>
  A little girl with Spanish eyes<br>
  When I saw her first in a pram they pushed her by<br>
  Oh my, my how you've grown<br>
  Well it's been, it's been... a little while<br></p>
  <p>
  Ooh<br>
  Ooh<br>
  Ooh<br>
  Slow down my beating heart</p>
  <p>
  A man dreams one day to fly<br>
  A man takes a rocket ship into the skies<br>
  He lives on a star that's dying in the night<br>
  And follows in the trail, the scatter of light<br>
  Turn it on, turn it on, you turn me on<br></p>
  <p>
  Ooh<br>
  Slow down my beating heart<br>
  Ooh<br>
  Slowly, slowly love<br>
  Slow down my beating heart<br>
  Slowly, slowly love<br>
  Slow down my beating heart<br>
  Slowly, slowly love<br></p>
