<p>
And you know it's time to go <br>
Through the sleet and driving snow <br>
Across the fields of mourning to a light that's in the distance. <br></p>
<p>
And you hunger for the time <br>
Time to heal, 'desire' time <br>
And your earth moves beneath your own dream landscape. <br></p>
<p>
On borderland we run. <br>
I'll be there, I'll be there tonight <br>
A high-road, a high-road out from here. <br></p>
<p>
The city walls are all come down <br>
The dust a smoke screen all around <br>
See faces ploughed like fields that once <br>
Gave no resistance. <br></p>
<p>
And we live by the side of the road <br>
On the side of a hill as the valleys explode <br>
Dislocated, suffocated <br>
The land grows weary of it's own. <br></p>
<p>
O com-away, o com-away, o-com, o com-away, I say I <br>
O com-away, o com-away, o-com, o com-away, I say I <br></p>
<p>
Oh, oh on borderland we run <br>
And still we run, we run and don't look back <br>
I'll be there, I'll be there <br>
Tonight, tonight <br></p>
<p>
I'll be there tonight, I believe <br>
I'll be there so high <br>
I'll be there tonight, tonight.<br></p>
<p>
Oh com-away, I say, o com-away, I say. <br></p>
<p>
The wind will crack in winter time <br>
This bomb-blast lightning waltz. <br>
No spoken words, just a scream <br>
Tonight we'll build a bridge across the sea and land <br>
See the sky, the burning rain <br>
She will die and live again tonight. <br></p>
<p>
And your heart beats so slow <br>
Through the rain and fallen snow <br>
Across the fields of mourning to a light that's in the distance. <br>
Oh, don't sorrow, no don't weep <br>
For tonight at last I am coming home. <br>
I am coming home.<br></p>
