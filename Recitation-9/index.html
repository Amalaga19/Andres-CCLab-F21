<p>
From father to son <br>
The blood runs thin<br>
Ooh, see the faces frozen (still)<br>
Against the wind.<br></p>
<p>
The seam is split<br>
The coal-face cracked<br>
The lines are long<br>
There's no going back.<br></p>
<p>
Through hands of steel<br>
And heart of stone<br>
Our labour day<br>
Has come and gone.<br></p>
<p>
They leave me holdin' on<br>
In Red Hill Town.<br>
See the lights go down on ...<br></p>
<p>
Hangin' on<br>
You're all that's left to hold on to.<br>
I'm still waiting<br>
I'm hangin' on<br>
You're all that's left to hold on to.<br>
<p>
The glass is cut<br>
The bottle run dry.<br>
Our love runs cold<br>
In the caverns of the night.<br></p>
<p>
We're wounded by fear<br>
Injured in doubt.<br>
I can lose myself<br>
You I can't live without.<br></p>
<p>
Yeah, you keep me holdin' on<br>
In Red Hill Town.<br>
See the lights go down on<br></p>
<p>
Hangin' on<br>
You're all that's left to hold on to.<br>
I'm still waiting<br>
I'm hangin' on<br>
You're all that's left to hold on to<br>
On to.<br></p>
<p>
We scorch the earth<br>
Set fire to the sky<br>
And we stooped so low<br>
To reach so high.<br></p>
<p>
A link is lost<br>
The chain undone.<br>
We wait all day<br>
For night to come<br>
And it comes like a hunter (child).<br></p>
<p>
I'm hangin' on<br>
You're all that's left to hold on to.<br>
I'm still waiting<br>
I'm hangin' on<br>
You're all that's left to hold on to.<br></p>
<p>
We see love, slowly stripped away<br>
Our love has seen its better day.<br>
Hangin' on<br>
Lights go down on Red Hill<br>
The lights go down on Red Hill.<br>
The lights go down on Red Hill.<br>
The lights go down on Red Hill Town.<br></p>
