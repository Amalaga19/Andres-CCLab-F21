      <h2> <p>What Are The Polar Lights?</p></h2>
      <h3> <p>The Polar Lights, also known as Aurorae Polaris (Borealis if they occur in the northern hemisphere, or Australis if they occur in the southern hemisphere), are a natural phenomenon that occurs in the sky near the poles of the Earth.</p> </h3>
    </div>
    <div id="Cause">
      <h2><p> What Causes Them?</p></h2>
      <h3> <p>They are caused by solar wind that impacts loose atoms in the atmosphere, releasing energy as light of different colors, depending on the atom the solar wind collided with.</p></h3>

    </div>
    <div id="Color">
      <p><h2> How Is Their Color Determined?</h2></p>
      <h3> <p>The color is determined by the element the solar wind collides with, which is also related to the altitude at which the collision occurs from. If it occurs between 100 and 300 kilometers above the surface of the Earth, it is most likely to be green, any higher and it's most likely to be red. Rarely it can also be pink or blue because the elements that produce these colors are not as common in the atmosphere as the elements that produce a red or green light.</p> </h3>

      <h3><p>A band where rays are visible is known as a curtain. This is the strongest form of an aurora that is composed of a single band.</h3></p>
